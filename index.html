  <h1 class="page-heading">Welcome, dear kitten!</h1>

  <p>This is an early alpha version of an awesome Jekyll tutorial that is going to help you build your very own website in just a day.</p>

  <p>The end result of this tutorial will be a CV/portfolio website with a blog that can be used to promote your own projects and to find new job opportunities. Along the way, you'll learn about the basics of making websites (HTML, CSS) and some concepts that can help you move onto more complex projects.</p>

  <p>Things you'll need for this tutorial:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>your own computer (Mac or PC) with administrative access</li>
  	<li>reliable internet access</li>
  	<li>6 - 18 hours of time (depending on whether you'll be working alone or with a coach)</li>
  	<li>some materials for your website (text and photos for your CV, should be prepared in advance)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The tutorial can either be used for workshops with coaches or at home. We'll prepare different notes for both scenarios.</p>

  <p>Some parts of this tutorial are still missing (especially more detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting) and the texts need a good proofread or two. But if you know somebody, who could benefit from learning Jekyll and has a Mac, feel free to give it a try and send us your feedback. Weâ€™ll be filling in the missing gaps and adding versions for Windows/Linux in the coming weeks.</p>

  <p>But if you're feeling brave (or even if you're still unsure), go ahead, jump to <a href="{{ "/1-installation" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Part 1</a> and start building your own website!</p>

  <p>P.S.: Yeah, and we also have to make it prettier and think of a cool name. Suggestions?</p>
