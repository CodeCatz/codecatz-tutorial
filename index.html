  <h1 class="page-heading">Welcome, dear kitten!</h1>

  <p>Please give us a few weeks to build this super awesome tutorial that is going to help you build your very own website in just a day.</p>

  <p>The end result of this tutorial will be a CV/portfolio website with a blog that can be used to promote your own projects and to find new job opportunities. Along the way, you'll learn about the basics of learning websites (HTML, CSS) and some concepts that can help you move onto more complex projects.</p>

  <p>Things you'll need for this tutorial:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>your own laptop with administrative access</li>
  	<li>reliable internet access</li>
  	<li>6 - 18 hours of time (depending on whether you'll be working alone or with a coach)</li>
  	<li>some materials for your website (text and photos for your CV, should be prepared in advance)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The tutorial can either be used for workshops with coaches or at home. We'll prepare different notes for both scenarios.</p>
